# Note Well on Gas



Be aware, there are different gas requirements for ERC20 tokens than there are to ETH itself. Be sure to use enough gas when sending an ERC20 transaction.

To send ERC20 tokens you must sign a transaction, which uses some itself gas. Gas is sold at a cost per unit price.

TransactionCost = gasUsed * gasPrice

An ERC20 token's gasUsed is "fixed".

If you can make any sense out of this, see: [Ethgasstation](https://ethgasstation.info/predictionTable.php).
